# how the program works

This program consists of a variety of functions that deal with arrays of integers. 

In the `maximum`  function, it takes an array of ints and its length, then returns the maximum element of that array.

The `sum_positive` function will take an array of ints and its length, then returns the sum of all of the elements of that array that are positive.

The `reduce` function combines all of the elements in an array with a specified function then it maintains a current cumulative value and applies the function to the cumulative value and each element of the given array. 

We then have a function for finding the maximum element of an array, summing all positive elements of an array, and counting all negative numers in an array, all with the `reduce` function.
